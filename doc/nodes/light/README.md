## Light

Represents a [Google Home Light](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/guides/light) device.

### Node attributes:
- [Common](../common.md)
- `Allow brightness control` - if checked, the device will support the brightness trait, allowing brightness control (0-100)
- `Turn on when brightness/color changes` - if checked will also turn on the device when there is any change to the color/brightness level
- `Send/receive complete state as payload` - if **unchecked**, it will send/receive as payload, only the brightness. Meaning a brightness of 0 will turn off the device, otherwise will turn it on to the set brightness.
- `Override brightness when input is 0` - Value to set the device brightness when a payload of 0 is sent to the input turning the device off. This is used only if `Send/receive complete state as payload` is unchecked.
- `Color support` - will enable the color support for the light. When this mode is used the payload is always an object with the light state. 3 color modes are supported:
  - RGB
  - HSV
  - Temperature
- `On Payload` - the payload sent/received when the light is on (only if brightness/color is not used).
- `Off Payload` - the payload sent/received when the light is off (only if brightness/color is not used).


### Input/output payload can be:
- a number representing the brightness. If `Allow brightness control` is checked and `Send/receive complete state as payload` is unchecked
- An object with the following properties
  - `online` - boolean: true/false, default: true. Flag that indicates if the device is online
  - `on` - boolean: true/false, default: false. Flag that indicates if the device is turned on or off
  - `brightness` - number: 0-100, default: 0. Brightness the light is set at in percentage (only if `Allow brightness control` is checked)
  - `color` - object that contains the color:
    - if `RGB` mode is used, it has a number property called `spectrumRgb` which contains the RGB value of the color
    - if `HSV` mode is used, it has 3 number properties called `hue` (0-360), `saturation` (0-1), `value` (0-1) which contain the HSV colro
    - if `Temperature` mode is used, it has a number property called `temperatureK` which contains the temperature in K degrees
