## Sensor

Represents a [Google Home Sensor](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/guides/sensor) device.

Node attributes:
- [Common](../common.md)
- `Temperature` - if checked, the sensor will report temperature
- `Temperature Unit` - select between C and F
- `Humidity` - if checked, the sensor will report relative humidity
- `Sensor` - if checked, the sensor will support the [sensor state trait](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/traits/sensorstate)
  - `Type` - type of sensor ([List of supported sensors](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/traits/sensorstate#supported-sensors))
  - `Numeric capability` - if checked, sensor will support numeric capability.
  - `Supported states` - the checked states will be reported to Google as supported.
  - if both `Numeric capability` and `Supported states` are missing, the sensor will support only numeric capability as a requirement.

Input payload will be an object that follow the payload defined in the attributes.

**Note:** you can also send messages with the state properties to the input of the node:
- `online` - boolean, default: true
- `temperature` - number - the temperature to report (in Celsius)
- `humidity` - number - the relative humidity to report (in %)
- `state` - string - the current state of the sensor descriptive capability if supported (Eg: *healthy*/*no carbon monoxide detected*/etc.)
- `value` - number - the current numeric sensor value (if supported)
